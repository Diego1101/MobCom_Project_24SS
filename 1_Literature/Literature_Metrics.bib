@article{Dia06,
 abstract = {In 2001, two information theoretic anonymity metrics were proposed: the {\textquotedbl}effective anonymity set size{\textquotedbl} and the {\textquotedbl}degree of anonymity{\textquotedbl}. In this talk, we propose an abstract model for a general anonymity system which is consistent with the definition of anonymity on which the metrics are based. We revisit entropy-based anonymity metrics, and we apply them to Crowds, a practical
anonymity system. We discuss the differences between the two metrics
and the results obtained in the example.},
