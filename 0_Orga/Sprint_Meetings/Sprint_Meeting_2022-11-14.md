# Sprint Meeting 2022-11-14

## Agenda

- [x] Progress update

## Protocol

- Start of WHISPER implementation (#10)
- Still problems with dynamic attacker. Ability to track attacker "visually" delayed (#6, #22)
- SLOW PCS is implemented correctly (#5)
- Anonymity set size privacy metric math is ready but not implemented (#19)
- Reconstruction of trace seems correct but attacker looses target often because of inaccurate position prediction. Prediction will be improved (#18)
